	In recent years salads have taken on a more important role in the modern kitchen. This has been due to the increase in health awareness along with a larger variety of quality fresh produce being supplied across the country.  Salads now have a n important place on the menu as entrées and chefs continue not only to search out new varieties of fruit and vegetables but have begun to look back to those heirloom varieties that have not been readily available for sometime.</p>

	<p>
	<p>They are suitable for eating at any time of the day or season of the year but make a particularly welcome contribution to the menu in the summer months when a wide variety of fresh home-grown produce is available at reasonable prices. They can be offered as part of the hor-d’oeuvre selection or as  as an accompaniment to cold meats, cold dishes or grills and roast meats</p>

It is important when making salads to understand the quality of ingredients being used.  The fresher the ingredients the more careful one has to be, not to cover up the nuances of those fresh ingredients. In some parts of the country it is difficult to obtain such ingredients on a regular bases and in these cases understanding how to bring out the best of what the product has to offer is paramount.


Salads should be simple and fresh in presentation and flavor.  They should be well thought out , and balanced in texture and nutritional content.  
<p>So to put in simple words, Salad should consist of  :</p>

<ul>
 <li>Fresh Ingredients</li>
 <li>Proper and Balanced Textures</li>
 <li>Attractive presentation</li>
 <li>Balance of Flavours</li>
</ul>

<h4>WEIGHT CONTROL</h4>
<p>Eating a fiber-rich salad before your entree will help you to feel full faster, so you’ll consume less calories than you might when a meal is served without this appetizer. The more raw vegetables you can incorporate into your salad, the greater the potential positive effects will be.</p>
<h4>	A NATURAL SOURCE OF FIBER</h4>

<p>Leafy greens and raw veggies are a superb source of natural fiber, and consuming enough fiber each day has many  health advantages like:
<ul>
<li>Fiber helps to reduce LDL or “bad” cholesterol.</li>
<li>It helps to control blood sugar.</li>
<li>Adequate fiber intake helps with weight loss and healthy weight maintenance.</li>
<li>It normalizes bowel movements, and aids in the prevention of bowel disease.</li>
<li>Proper fiber intake has been shown to reduce the recurrence and prevention of a number of cancers </li>
</ul>

<h4>INTAKE OF HEALTHY FATS</h4>

<p>Adding a couple of tablespoons of mixed raw or roasted seeds like pumpkin, sesame, sunflower and ground flax or chia will boost our daily intake of good fats. Experimenting with different kinds of oils in the dressings will help with this, too.
</p>
